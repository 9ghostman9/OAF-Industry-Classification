The \"employers\" column seems straightforward enough, but the \"description\" column is a bit more complicated. It all seems to pertain to the company, but the content of the descriptions seem to vary. For example, the description above starts with an advertisement for the company, but then also includes some kind of review from a former employee who accuses the company of racist and sexist practice. It seems like, often, pieces of information from distinct sources are separated by two or three periods (\"...\"). It seems like most numeric information will probably not be that helpful. Phone numbers, dates, mailing addresses, etc. I think, for the purposes of the model, these kinds of information will not be very useful. Additionally, punctuation in the reviews section should be cleaned out, as they are not necessary to the data.",

   "source": "The two lemmatization techniques (WordNet and Spacy) seem to produce nearly identical results, although WordNet seemed to process much faster than Spacy. Compared to stemming, lemmatization excels in where stemming fails: over or under reacting on certain words. For example, stemming seemed to heavily react to words that ended in the letter 'e'. It would overstem in many cases. This overstemming could potentially heavily interfere with the data set. On the other hand, lemmatization seemed to process the data set smoothly and stayed relatively true the data set. Words aren't as harshly acted upon and are treated more equitably. There does not seem to be too big of an overreaction nor an underreaction. That said, its better results came at the price of a much higher processing time (over 15 minutes without cache) compared to the time for stemming (around 5 minutes without cache).",

Information that was either irrelevant or impossible for the model to act on, of which there was a lot, is largely gone, and the remaining information has been transformed into a format that will be easier to process. Most of the information that we deemed irrelevant consisted of dates, websites, punctuation, phone numbers, and metadata. While that information may be valuable to the average consumer, such information had little to zero purpose in our aggregate data and were thus discarded. \n#### Stemming V.S. Lemmatization\nBoth stemming and lemmatization found some success in simplifying the text. However, while stemming techniques tened to oversimplify, and therefore lost some of the information communicated in the text, lemmatization techniques tended not to simplify quite enough, and so produced results that sometimes left similar words that will look different in the model (this problem seems far less severe than that of stemming). Ultimately, we found that lemmatization created results that contained more of the original meaning behind the text, as opposed to stemming. \nIn short: Lemmatization is more accurate and stays relatively truer to the data than stemmization; stemmization is faster to process than lemmatization.",
