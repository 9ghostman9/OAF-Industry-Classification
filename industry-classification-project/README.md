Overall, it was very educational experience. I learned a lot about data science and how models are used in order to create connections.
Doing research on vectorizers such as CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer gave me new ideas on how to utilize them in my project.
My favorite research was done on NMF, non negative matrix factorization. It was a very interesting concept and being able to use it in my
own project satisfied me. Overall, my group came up with the best predictions using a CountVectorized LDA model. It was very accurate in
predicting industries in the education, financial, healthcare, and network providers. Unfortunately, it was unable to go beyond those
industries. Some of the major challenges that I had to come to face with were the challenges of handling huge amounts of data.Working
with huge chunks of data resulted in many instances of the kernal crashing due to too much memory usage. The wayaround was to optimize
your code and avoid doing unnecessary things that would consume memory. With time and guidance of my mentor Antoine, I was able to
overcome my obstacle. After this project, I want to continue looking at different models and strategies modern data scientists use.
I also want to learn how to optimize my code for best memory usage and speeds.
